I will join the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences ([SEAS](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/)) at Harvard University this fall. Previously, I graduated from Tsinghua University with summa cum laude, and got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology in June 2022. I was fortunate to be a member of "Yao Class".

My research interests lie in the science of intelligent systems and decision making, including optimal control theory, reinforcement learning and optimization.
