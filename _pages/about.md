<b><font size=5>Yang Hu (胡扬)</font></b>  
G1 CS PhD student  
SEAS, Harvard University

I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at Harvard University, affiliated to the John. A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences ([SEAS](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/)). I am fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Na Li](https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/) and [Prof. Sham Kakade](https://sham.seas.harvard.edu/). I am also a member of [the Harvard Machine Learning Foundations Group](https://mlfoundations.org/).

I am broadly interested in the theoretical foundations of intelligent systems and **decision making**, with the ultimate goal of obtaining a better understanding of **collective intelligence in complex systems**. More specifically, I am devoted to designing **efficient algorithms** that enables learning-based strategic moves in large-scale multi-agent systems equipped with various dynamics structures, and developing theory that reveals the **fundamental limit** of online decision-making algorithms. My current research focuses on **multi-agent systems**, which lies in the intersection of game theory, online control, reinforcement learning and machine learning, and is thus interdisciplinary by nature.
