<b><font size=5>Yang Hu (胡扬)</font></b>  
G1 CS PhD student  
SEAS, Harvard University

I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at Harvard University, affiliated to the John. A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences ([SEAS](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/)). I am fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Na Li](https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/) and [Prof. Sham Kakade](https://sham.seas.harvard.edu/). I am also a member of [the Harvard Machine Learning Foundations Group](https://mlfoundations.org/).

I am broadly interested in the theory behind intelligent systems and decision making, with the aim of pursuing a better understanding about the nature of collective intelligence in complex systems. My current research focuses on multi-agent systems, including game theory, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and multi-agent online control.
