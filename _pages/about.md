<b><font size=5>Yang Hu (胡扬)</font></b>\\
G1 CS PhD student\\
SEAS, Harvard University\\

       yanghu [at] g [dot] harvard [dot] edu *(academic)*

I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at Harvard University, affiliated to the John. A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences ([SEAS](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/)). I am fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Na Li](https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/) and [Prof. Sham Kakade](https://sham.seas.harvard.edu/). I am also a member of [the Harvard Machine Learning Foundations Group](https://mlfoundations.org/).

I am broadly interested in the theory behind intelligent systems and decision making. My current research focuses on multi-agent systems, including repeated games, Markov games, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and multi-input control.

**About "Yao Class"**\\
Previously, in June 2022, I graduated from the Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences ([IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/about/)) at Tsinghua University, and got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology with *summa cum laude*.

I was fortunate to be a member of ["Yao Class"](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/), which was founded by, and named after, the world-celebrated computer scientist [Prof. Chi-Chih Yao](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/yao/). It attracts the most talented students who are interested in computer science all around China.
