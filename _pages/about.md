I am a senior-year undergraduate at "Yao Class" affiliated to IIIS, Tsinghua University. I am about to get my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology in June, 2022, and I am actively applying for graduate school now.

My research interests lie in the science of intelligent systems and decision making, such as optimal control theory, reinforcement learning and optimization.
